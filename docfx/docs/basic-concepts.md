# Basic Concepts

The following outlines good to know, basic concepts for ZeroRedact.

## What is redaction?

Redaction is obscuring a piece of data. We often use it to protect private or confidential information such as [Personally Identifiable Information](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_data) (PII). This is what you see in documents with blacked out lines. 

Redaction is the goal of ZeroRedact.

This similar, but different to *masking*, [via AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/what-is/data-masking/):
>Data masking creates fake versions of an organization's data by changing confidential information. Various techniques are used to create realistic and structurally similar changes. Once data is masked, you canâ€™t reverse engineer or track back to the original data values without access to the original dataset.

A simple example for masking would be taking an address, and replacing each part (street number, suburb, etc) with a different but valid piece of data. The address is still an address structure and valid looking, but now isn't the PII it was before.

## Configuration 

ZeroRedact uses a cascading configuration model. Options "closer" to the redaction time will overwrite prior options. For example, the redaction character can be set in three places:

1. On `RedactorOptions` at `Redactor` construction time
1. On a specific redaction type option, such as `StringRedactorOptions` which can be passed to the `Redactor` object at construction time
1. In the redaction call, such as passing `StringRedactorOptions` to `RedactString()`

The third will take precedence over all previous settings. This allows for good defaults and fine grained control when needed.

## Exceptions

ZeroRedact will not throw exceptions during _redaction_. If an exception occurs, a default fixed length redaction is provided. This is from a safety first perspective where the highest level of redaction is used when the situation is unknown. This is preferrable over leaking data or interrupting code flow.
